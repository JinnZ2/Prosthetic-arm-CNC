This open-source project uses natural geometry to reinvent prosthetics.
By combining the golden ratio (1.618) with CNC precision and EMG sensor optimization, this system designs and manufactures prosthetic sockets with mathematically ideal comfort, fit, and signal performance.

The entire system runs in JavaScript and outputs real-world CNC toolpaths, sensor pocket layouts, and detailed manufacturing metrics â€” enabling low-cost, high-quality myoelectric prosthetics to be produced anywhere.

# Prosthetic-arm-CNC
Golden Ratio CNC Prosthetic Arm System  A precision-engineered, bio-optimized prosthetic socket and manufacturing system built using the golden ratio. Designed for affordable, high-performance myoelectric arms. Generates complete toolpaths, sensor layouts, and production reports for CNC fabrication.
